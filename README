# A custom Keyboard Layout to fit my needs

This Keyboard Layout is a simple extension to the default US Layout to add äöü (adiaeresis, udiaeresis and odiaeresis) to aou because a native german needs diaeresis letters way more often than you might think.

## Install

Simply copy the file to
/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/
change owner to root

Add

    <model>
      <configItem>
        <name>gwrx</name>
        <description>Generic 101 de_US Layout</description>
        <vendor>gwrx</vendor>
      </configItem>
    </model>

to /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/evdev.xml

and choose your layout in the gnome keyboard settings application
